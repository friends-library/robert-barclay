The greatest part of this booklet is an updated version of the eleventh
proposition of Robert Barclay's [.book-title]#Apology for the True Christian Divinity#.^
footnote:[Robert Barclay's [.book-title]#Apology for the True
Christian Divinity# is made available online for free,
and hardcover copies can be purchased through Quaker Heritage Press.
www.qhpress.org]
The entire volume of Barclay's [.book-title]#Apology# (consisting of fifteen
propositions in all) is a tremendous and compelling work that
I strongly recommend to every serious seeker of the Truth.
I have chosen to modernize and republish just this one proposition
because it seems to me that the invaluable practice of waiting upon
the Lord has been especially neglected,
and has all but disappeared from the church today.

The short appendix that begins on page 59 is an excerpt
from [.book-title]#The Works of Isaac Penington# on the same subject.
